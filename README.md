# Portfolio

This contains some projects that make up part of my portfolio. Enjoy!

## [Reddit API Pipeline](https://github.com/ABZ-Aaron/Reddit-API-Pipeline)

*Python | SQL | Docker | Airflow | AWS | DBT*

This is a personal project I worked on after completing a Data Engineering **Zoomcamp**. The purpose was to build a data pipeline, and develop basic skills across a range of technologies.

## [Data Engineering Bootcamp](https://github.com/ABZ-Aaron/DataEngineerZoomCamp)

*Python | PostgreSQL | Docker | Terraform | Google Cloud Platform | Kafka*

This is an online zoomcamp/bootcamp I've recently started. Can't say it's been easy, but this is providing a great opportunity for me to develop my skills, and learn a ton of new technologies and tools.

## [SQL Twitter Tutorials](https://github.com/ABZ-Aaron/SQL-Tutorials)

*SQL*

This contains a series of basic SQL tutorials I've been publishing on Twitter.

## [Flask Mega Tutorial](https://github.com/ABZ-Aaron/Microblog)

*Python | Flask | Unit Testing | SQLite | SQLAlchemy | HTML | CSS*

This is a mega tutorial I am completing on Flask. Still in progress...

## [Psychology Experiment](https://github.com/ABZ-Aaron/Experiment)

*Python | PsychoPy*

The files here allow one to run a Stroop Task on multiple participants, before running a basic analysis on the results. This was one of the first Python projects I worked on with minimal tutorials or assistance. It was here that I learned how to program, and began to develop some proficiency with Python. 

## [Mock Media App](https://github.com/ABZ-Aaron/MediaApp)

*Python | Object Orientated Programming | Event Driven Programming | Tkinter*

This is a basic Python application developed using Tkinter. It's not a real media app, as the project was more intended to as practice. Specifically this helped me gain an appreciation of event driven and object orientated programming. 

## [Cheatsheets](https://github.com/ABZ-Aaron/CheatSheets)

This is where I store various cheatsheets that I've created to help my followers on Twitter and LinkedIn.

## [File Search](https://github.com/ABZ-Aaron/FileSearch/)

*Python | Event Driven Programming | Tkinter*

This is a python application developed using Tkinter. This apps allows one to search all text files within a specified directory for a specified string. This saves results to a listbox, as well as a CSV. This is very basic, but may be built upon in the future.

## [ASCII Art](https://github.com/ABZ-Aaron/ASCII)

*Python | PIL*

This is a python script which can convert a normal image into ASCII-Art. It was completed as a guided project to help develop my skills in Python.
