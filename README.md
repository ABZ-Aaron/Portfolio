# Portfolio

This contains some projects that make up part of my portfolio. Enjoy!

## [Psychology Experiment](https://github.com/ABZ-Aaron/Experiment)

*Python | PsychoPy*

The files here allow one to run a Stroop Task on multiple participants, before running a basic analysis on the results. This was one of the first Python projects I worked on with minimal tutorials or assistance. It was here that I learned how to program, and began to develop some proficiency with Python. 

## [Mock Media App](https://github.com/ABZ-Aaron/MediaApp)

*Python | Object Orientated Programming | Event Driven Programming | Tkinter*

This is a basic Python application developed using Tkinter. It's not a real media app, as the project was more intended to as practice. Specifically this helped me gain an appreciation of event driven and object orientated programming.
