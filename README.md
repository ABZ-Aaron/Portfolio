# Portfolio

This contains some projects that make up part of my portfolio. Enjoy!

## [Psychology Experiment](https://github.com/ABZ-Aaron/Experiment)

*Python | PsychoPy*

The files here allow one to run a Stroop Task on multiple participants, before running a basic analysis on the results. This was one of the first Python projects I worked on with minimal tutorials or assistance. It was here that I learned how to program, and began to develop some proficiency with Python. 

## [Mock Media App](https://github.com/ABZ-Aaron/MediaApp)

*Python | Object Orientated Programming | Event Driven Programming | Tkinter*

This is a basic Python application developed using Tkinter. It's not a real media app, as the project was more intended to as practice. Specifically this helped me gain an appreciation of event driven and object orientated programming. 

## [File Search](https://github.com/ABZ-Aaron/FileSearch/)

*Python | Event Driven Programming | Tkinter*

This is a python application developed using Tkinter. This apps allows one to search all text files within a specified directory for a specified string. This saves results to a listbox, as well as a CSV. This is very basic, but may be built upon in the future.

## [ASCII Art](https://github.com/ABZ-Aaron/ASCII)

*Python | PIL*

This is a python script which can convert a normal image into ASCII-Art. It was completed as a guided project to help develop my skills in Python.

## [DataQuest Data Engineering](https://github.com/ABZ-Aaron/DataQuestDE)

*Python | SQL*

This contains a series of projects I have completed as part of the Data Engineering track via DataQuest (in progress).
